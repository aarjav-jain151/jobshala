## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup (Local Development)

Follow these steps to clone the repository and run the project locally.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    First, navigate to the folder where you want to store your projects, and then clone the repository.
    ```bash
    # 1. Clone the project (downloads the code)
    git clone [https://github.com/aarjav-jain151/jobshala.git](https://github.com/aarjav-jain151/jobshala.git)
    
    # 2. Change directory into the new project folder
    cd jobshala
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies (Backend & Frontend):**

    You need to install packages for both the server and the client.
    ```bash
    # Install backend dependencies
    cd backend
    npm install
    
    # Install frontend dependencies (navigate back, then into frontend)
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Setup Environment Variables:**

    Create a file named **`.env`** inside the **`backend`** directory. Add your specific credentials here. **Note:** The `MONGO_URI` below should be the working string from your MongoDB Atlas setup (including any URL-encoding for the password).
    
    ```env
    # Replace these placeholders with your actual secrets
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://<YOUR_ATLAS_USER>:<YOUR_URL_ENCODED_PASS>@<YOUR_CLUSTER_URL>/jobportal_app
    JWT_SECRET_KEY=A_NEW_LONG_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY_FOR_LOCAL_DEV
    
    # Local Development Settings
    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=8000
    FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
    ```

4.  **Run the Project:**

    Open two separate terminals/tabs in VS Code to run the frontend and backend simultaneously.
    ```bash
    # Terminal 1: Start Backend Server
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    
    # Terminal 2: Start Frontend Application
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be live in your browser at **`http://localhost:5173`**.
